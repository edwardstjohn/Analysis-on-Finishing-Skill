Note: code initally made on a private City University repo for the MSc, hence lack of commit tracking in this repo.

The aim of this paper is to investigate whether a better finishing skill model could be made by splitting up shot data into long- and short-range shots, and predicting future performance based solely on the over/under performance of those subsets of shots. Seven seasonsâ€™ worth of data is used underlying this analysis, with predictions performed on unseen 2021 data to provide an unbiased test. This study finds that short-range shots actually provide a better estimation of future performance when compared to a general model (predicting based on all past shots from a player) and a long-range model (predicting solely on long shot ability), rejecting our hypothesis of a long-range model providing a more accurate prediction of future goals scored based off Expected Goals.
